Hi! I'm Aniket Maithani, a passionate software engineer with extensive experience in building scalable systems and cloud infrastructure. I specialize in Python development and cloud technologies, particularly Google Cloud Platform.

I love working on challenging technical problems and sharing my knowledge with the developer community. Through this blog, I'll be writing about my experiences with cloud computing, Python development best practices, and various software engineering topics that I encounter in my day-to-day work.

Currently, I'm exploring the exciting world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to build scalable automated solutions. I'm particularly interested in how these technologies can be leveraged to create intelligent systems that can process and understand complex information while maintaining high performance at scale.
